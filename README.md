# WeaponTech
Weapon Tech replaces and expands the vanilla weapon research, with a larger emphasis on chronological progression. This means starting with smoothbore muzzle-loaders, and finishing with state-of-the-art gauss weapons. Also featured are composite vests, mannable turrets, and bonus weapons; guns that can only be bought or scavenged, much like the Megascreen Television and Telescope.
